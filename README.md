# Munitions Wastewater Life Cycle Assessment
openLCA files for munitions wastewater life cycle assessment. 

Description
This repository contains the .zolca file used for conducting a life cycle assessment for evaluating the environmental impacts of several wastewater treatment technologies considered for munitions wastewater treatment. These technologies include: granular activated carbon (GAC), ion exchange (IX), reverse osmosis (RO), anaerobic granular reactor (ANGR), aerobic granular reactor (AGR), ultra-violet light catalyzed hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2), and ozone. Since each of these technologies on their own serve different treatment purposes, the life cycle assessment considered combinations of technologies (e.g. IX with ANGR and ozone). 

Data formats and license requirements
The database file included in the repository is a .zolca file. openLCA software is required to open the .zolca file. To view the inventory data within the .zolca file in its entirety, an ecoinvent database license is also required.
